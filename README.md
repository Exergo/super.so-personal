###Move custom code to a CDN/Github Pages
Moving your custom code to a CDN not only makes your code more organised and easier to manage, it also makes your template easily sharable and saves users having to copy and paste hundreds of lines of custom code. Put simply, a CDN is a place to store your custom code online.


Github Pages

Github Pages can work as a CDN and it's free to use! To get started visit this page and follow the instructions. Once you've created a Repository and linked it to Github Pages follow the instructions below to upload your template files:

Create a folder inside the repository and give it a name (use your template name)
Then create a new file inside that folder called 'style.css' 
Next paste your Custom Code from Super into this file and commit the new file
Head back into Super and in the Code page under the 'Head' tab, include a link to your new css file. You can use the snippet below as a guide, make sure to replace USERNAME and THEME-NAME in the URL below.
```<link href="https://USERNAME.github.io/THEME-NAME/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />```
